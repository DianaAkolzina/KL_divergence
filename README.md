# KL Divergence Minimization

This Python script calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a target distribution and several randomly generated distributions. The goal is to find the distribution with the minimum KL divergence compared to the target distribution. The script also generates plots of the distributions and their KL divergences.

## Dependencies

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Functions

1. `generate_distributions(num_distributions, num_samples)`: Generates a specified number of random distributions using the Dirichlet distribution.
2. `kl_divergence(p, q)`: Calculates the KL divergence between two probability distributions `p` and `q`.
3. `find_min_kl_divergence(distributions, target_distribution)`: Finds the distribution with the minimum KL divergence compared to the target distribution.
4. `find_all_kl_divergences(distributions, target_distribution)`: Returns a dictionary containing the KL divergence for each distribution compared to the target distribution.

## Explanation

The script first generates random distributions using the Dirichlet distribution, which is a continuous multivariate probability distribution. It can be seen as a generalization of the Beta distribution. The Dirichlet distribution is useful in Bayesian inference as a conjugate prior of a multinomial distribution.

The KL divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution differs from another. It is used in various applications, such as information theory, machine learning, and statistical inference. In this script, we calculate the KL divergence between each generated distribution and the target distribution.

After calculating the KL divergence for each distribution, the script finds the distribution with the minimum KL divergence and plots all the distributions. The KL divergences for each distribution are also printed.

The actual data file does these with the famous Iris dataset. 

## Applications

- In information theory, KL divergence is used to quantify the difference between two probability distributions, providing insights into the relative entropy or information gain.
- In machine learning, KL divergence is used in model selection and evaluation, where it helps compare different models or learning algorithms.
- In statistical inference, KL divergence can be used to evaluate goodness of fit and compare the performance of various statistical models.
